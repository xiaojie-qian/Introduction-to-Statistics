## Quizz
1. Scores on a certain test follow the normal curve with an average of 1350 and a standard deviation of 120.
What percentage of test takers score below 1230?  (Use the empirical rule.)

> 16%, 1230 is one standard deviation below the average, so by the empirical rule, the test takers scoring below 1230 represent 50% minus half of the 68% of test scores that are within one standard deviation of the average.  That is, 50 - 34 = 16.

2. As in the previous question, scores on a certain test follow the normal curve with an average of 1350 and a standard deviation of 120. 
In order to qualify for a certain job, a candidate needs to score in the top 2.5%. What score does she need?

>1590, By the empirical rule, 95% of the test scores are within two standard deviations of the average.  Thus 5% are more than two standard deviations away from the average, so that 2.5% are two standard deviations above the average.  That is, the top 2.5% are the scores above 1350 + 2(120) = 1590.

3. Recall that the main object in a boxplot is a box that is bounded by the first and the third quartiles. So the length of the box is the difference between the third and the first quartile, which is called the interquartile range. This is a measure of spread of the data; it is sometimes used as an alternative to the standard deviation.  
If the data follow the normal curve, then the interquartile range equals how many standard deviations? (You may use the fact that the z-value of the third quartile is 0.7.)

> 1.4, Since the z-value of the third quartile tells us its distance to the left or right of the mean, measured in standard deviations, we are told that the third quartile is 0.7 standard deviations to the right of the mean. By symmetry, this means that the first quartile is 0.7 to the left of the mean, and the distance between the two quartiles is 2(0.7) = 1.4.

4. A multiple choice exam has 5 questions. Each question has 4 possible answers, of which one is correct. If a student guesses the answers to all five questions, what the chances that he gets 2 correct?

> (5!/2!3!) * (4/1)^2 * (3/4)^3, The probability of success is 1/4, of failure is 3/4,  so any sequence of five guesses with exactly two correct answers (and thus three incorrect answers has a probability of (4/1)^2 * (3/4)^3, and the number of such sequences is (5!/2!3!)
(Numerically, this give us 270/4^5 = 0.2637270/4^5 = 0.2637, or 26.37\%26.37%.)

5. A fair coin is tossed 6 times. What are the chances of getting 2 tails in each the first 3 and the last 3 tosses?

> (2!1!/3!(1/2)^3) * (2!1!/3!(1/2)^3) = (3/8)^2, With a fair coin, any specific sequence of nn tosses will have probability (1/2)^n, so the probability of a specific sequence of 3 tosses is (1/2)^3, 
The number of 3-toss sequences with 2 tails and 1 one head is 2!1!/3! = 3, so the probability of getting exactly 2 tails in the first 3 of 6 six tosses is 3/8.
The probability getting exactly 2 tails in the last 3 of 6 six tosses is the same, so the probability of getting them in both the first 3 and last 3 tosses is the square.
(Numerically, this gives us 9/64 = 0.14069/64=0.1406, or 14.06\%14.06%.)

6. A fair coin is tossed 400 times. Approximately what are the chances to get more than 210 tails?  (Use the empirical rule and the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.)

> 16%, From the normal approximation to a binomial distribution for 400 trials and 1/2 probability of success, the mean number of successes is 400(1/2) = 200, and the standard deviation is the square root of 400(1/2)(1/2), which is 10. So 210 successes is one standard deviation above the mean. From the empirical rule, one half of 68% of the data lies within one standard deviation to the right of the mean, so 50 + (1/2)68 = 84% of the data lies to the left of 210.  That is, 16% percent of the data lies to right of 210.
