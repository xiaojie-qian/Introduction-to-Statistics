## Quizz
1.　A town has 10,000 registered voters, of whom 6,000 are voting for the Democratic party. A survey organization is taking a sample of 100 registered voters (assume sampling with replacement). The percentage of Democratic voters in the sample will be around _____, give or take ____. (You may use the fact that the standard deviation of 6,000  1s and 4,000 0s is about 0.5)

> P = 6000 / 10000 = 60%, give or take: σ/sqrt(n) = 0.5/10 = 5%
60%, give or take 5%

2. You solicit 100 pledges for a charitable organization. Each pledge is equally likely to be $10, $50, or $100. You may use the fact that the standard deviation of the three amounts $10, $50 and $100 is $37. What is the expected value of the sum of the 100 pledges?
>  (10 + 50 + 100) /3 * 100 = 5333

3. You solicit 100 pledges for a charitable organization. Each pledge is equally likely to be $10, $50, or $100. You may use the fact that the standard deviation of the three amounts $10, $50 and $100 is $37. What are the chances that the 100 pledges total more than $5,700 ?

> SE(Sn) = σ * sqrt(n) = 37 * 10 = 370 -> (5700 - 5333) / 370 = 1 -> 1 sdv above the sum of the mean -> 1 - 0.5 * 68% - 50% = 16%

4. There are two candidates running for governor in CA and they are said to have roughly equal support from the voters. To get a better idea who is ahead, a company polls 400 of the 20 million registered voters in California. Likewise, there are two candidates running for mayor in Palo Alto who are said to have roughly equal support, and the company polls 400 out of the 20,000 registered voters in Palo Alto.  Will the first poll be more accurate, equally accurate, or less accurate than the second poll?

> equally accurate, because the standard error is the same since it depends on the size of the sample, not the size of the population.

5. The average taxable income reported on tax returns for the year 2016 is $ 45,000, and the standard deviation of the taxable incomes is $ 23,000. Which of the following two statements are true? Both? 

> The percentage of taxable incomes that fall below $ 30,000 can be computed from the above information using normal approximation.-> Income is skewed distribution. 

> **The chances that the sum of 100 randomly selected taxable incomes exceeds $ 4 million can be computed from the above information using normal approximation.** -> The central limit theorem applies to the sum of 100 draws.

6. (a)-(d) below relate to the following situation: Someone tosses a fair coin 100 times.
Question (a): How many tails can she expect to get?
> P = np = 100 * 0.5 = 50 

<br>

7. Question (b): What is the "give and take" number for the result from Question (a)?
> SE(Sn) = sqrt(np * (1-p) = sqrt ( 100 * 1/2 * (1 - 1/2) ) = 5

<br>

8. Question (c): What are the chances that she gets between 40 and 60 tails?
> SE (%) = σ/sqrt(n) = 0.5 / 10 = 5% -> σ = 50 -> sdv = (50% - 40%) / 5% = 2, sdv = (60% - 50%) / 5% = 2 -> 95% 

<br>

9. A large group of people get together and everyone tosses a coin 100 times.
Question (d): About what percentage of people will get between 40 and 60 tails?

> 95% -> From Question (c), the probability that the number of successes in a run of 100 binomial experiments will be between 40 and 60 is 95%.  But this just means that we expect 95 out of every 100 such runs of 100 binomial experiments to each yield a total number of successes that is between 40 and 60.   In other words, we expect this will be true for 95% of people.
