## Quizz
1. A town has 10,000 registered voters, of whom 6,000 are voting for the Democratic party. A survey organization is taking a sample of 100 registered voters (assume sampling with replacement). The percentage of Democratic voters in the sample will be around _____, give or take ____. (You may use the fact that the standard deviation of 6,000  1s and 4,000 0s is about 0.5)

> 60%, give or take 5%, The percentage of Democratic voters in the sample is equal to the mean of the sample, and so the "around" value is the expected value of the sample mean, which in turn is equal to the population mean, 0.60 or 60%.  Similarly, the "give or take" value is the standard error of the mean, which is equal to σ/sqrt(n),
where \sigmaσ is the standard deviation of the population and nn is the size of the sample.  We're told that σ is about 0.5 and nn is 100, so the standard error of the mean is 0.05 or 5%.

2. You solicit 100 pledges for a charitable organization. Each pledge is equally likely to be $10, $50, or $100. You may use the fact that the standard deviation of the three amounts $10, $50 and $100 is $37.
What is the expected value of the sum of the 100 pledges?

> $5333, The expected value of the sum of a sample is n\munμ, where nn is the size of the sample and \muμ is the mean of the population. Here we're told that nn is 100 and \muμ must be the average of $10, $50, and $100, which is $53.33, so the expected value of the sample sum is $5333.

3. You solicit 100 pledges for a charitable organization. Each pledge is equally likely to be $10, $50, or $100. You may use the fact that the standard deviation of the three amounts $10, $50 and $100 is $37.
What are the chances that the 100 pledges total more than $5,700 ?

> 16%, The standard error of the sample sum is sqrt(n) * σ. where nn is the sample size and \sigmaσ is the standard deviation of the population. Since nn is 100 and we're told that the standard deviation of the population is $37, we know the standard error of the sample sum is $370. Using the normal approximation to the sampling distribution, this tells us that $5700 is roughly one standard deviation (5700 - 5333 = 366) above the mean of the sampling distribution. From the empirical rule, we know that one half of 68% of the data lies within one standard deviation to the right of the mean, so that 50 + (1/2)68 = 84% of the data lies to the left of $5700.  That is, 16% percent of the data lies to right of $5700.

4.There are two candidates running for governor in CA and they are said to have roughly equal support from the voters. To get a better idea who is ahead, a company polls 400 of the 20 million registered voters in California. Likewise, there are two candidates running for mayor in Palo Alto who are said to have roughly equal support, and the company polls 400 out of the 20,000 registered voters in Palo Alto.  Will the first poll be more accurate, equally accurate, or less accurate than the second poll?

> equally accurate, The standard error is the same since it depends on the size of the sample, not the size of the population.

5.The average taxable income reported on tax returns for the year 2016 is $ 45,000, and the standard deviation of the taxable incomes is $ 23,000. 
Which of the following two statements are true? Both? 

- The percentage of taxable incomes that fall below $ 30,000 can be computed from the above information using normal approximation.

- **The chances that the sum of 100 randomly selected taxable incomes exceeds $ 4 million can be computed from the above information using normal approximation.**

> The central limit theorem applies to the sum of 100 draws.

6. Questions (a)-(d) below relate to the following situation: Someone tosses a fair coin 100 times.
Question (a): How many tails can she expect to get?

> 50, The expected value of the number of successes in  nn binomial experiments with probability of success pp is npnp, which in this case is 100(1/2).

<br>

7.Question (b): What is the "give and take" number for the result from Question (a)?

> 5, The standard error of the number of successes in nn binomial experiments with probability of success pp is sqrt(np(1-p)), which in this case is sqrt(100 * 1/2 *1/2) 

8. Question (c): What are the chances that she gets between 40 and 60 tails?
9. 
> 95%, From Questions (a) and (b), the expected number of successes is 50 and its standard error is 5, so that using the normal approximation, the values in the range 40-60 are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.  The empirical rule then gives that 95% of the data falls in this range.

9. A large group of people get together and everyone tosses a coin 100 times.

Question (d): About what percentage of people will get between 40 and 60 tails?

> 95%, From Question (c), the probability that the number of successes in a run of 100 binomial experiments will be between 40 and 60 is 95%.  But this just means that we expect 95 out of every 100 such runs of 100 binomial experiments to each yield a total number of successes that is between 40 and 60.   In other words, we expect this will be true for 95% of people.
