## Quizz
1. Which of the following statements are true? (Select all that apply.)

- **The p-value depends on the data.**
- If the pp-value is smaller than 5%, then there is less than a 5% chance that the null hypothesis is true.
- **If the null hypothesis is true, then there is less than a 5% chance to get a p-value that is smaller than 5%.**
> A p-value is a measure of the chance of witnessing the observed data assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
- **If a data scientist does many tests, then even if all the null hypotheses are true, a certain proportion will be rejected in error.**
> To say that an event is unlikely assuming a null hypothesis is true does not mean it's impossible under that assumption: Unlikely events can and do occur.

2. Read the first five paragraphs of the article "Online daters do better in the marriage stakes" by Regina Nuzzo in Nature News, 2013. [You can find it on the internet or here]. The main claim of the article is that there is a statistically significant difference in marital outcomes between couples that meet online and couples that meet in other ways. Is this finding is of practical relevance?

> no, Because a result is statistically significant does not have to mean it is practically relevant: The difference between 92% and 94% is not practically relevant.

3. A fair coin is tossed 100 times.
Which of the following statements are true?  (Select all that apply.)

- **The standard error for the percentage of heads among the 100100 tosses is 5%.**
> because the standard deviation of binomial experiment with probability of success pp is sqrt{p(1-p)}, the standard error for the proportion of successes in a run of nn such experiments is \frac{\sqrt{p(1-p)}}{\sqrt{n}} 
sqrt(p(1−p))/sqrt(n).  Thus in our case, the standard error for the proportion of heads in 100 tosses is sqrt(1/2 * 1/2) / sqrt(100) = 1/20 = 5% 
\frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}}}{\sqrt{100}} = \frac{1}{20} = 0.05, and the corresponding standard error for the percentage of heads is 5%.

- **The standard error for the percentage of tails among the 100 tosses is 5%.**
- The standard error for the quantity "percentage of heads - percentage of tails is sqrt{0.05^2 + 0.05^2} =7%.

4.Is there a relationship between age and insomnia?  A random sample of 184 people ages 18-29 was taken, and it was found that 26.1% suffer from insomnia and 73.9% do not. A separate random sample of 811 people ages 30 and over was taken, and it was found that 39.2% suffer from insomnia and 60.8% do not.

Which of the following four test statistics are appropriate for testing whether the prevalence of insomnia is different between the two age groups? (Select all that are.)

> z= (0.261−0.392)/sqrt(0.261(1−0.261)/184 + 0.392(1−0.392)/811)

5. You want to test whether plain M&Ms really contain 24% blue M&Ms as claimed on the manufacturer's web site. You sample 500 plain M&Ms at random and count the fraction of blue M&Ms.
Which of the following tests is appropriate to address this question?

- **z-test**
> The zz-test is appropriate since we're testing a proportion or percentage.

- t-test

- 2-sample zz-test

- sign test

- paired-difference test

6. A high school principal wants to find out whether the average SAT score of this year's graduating class is higher than last year's. She samples 13 students from this year's graduating class at random and wants to compare their average SAT score to the average SAT score from last year's graduating class.


- z-test

- **t-test**
> Because the question doesn't suggest or imply a clear choice for the standard deviation of the population, it requires us to use the sample 
standard deviation.  This and the fact that the sample size is less than 20 means that our use of the sample standard deviation could lead us to draw invalid conclusions 
from the normal approximation used to apply the zz-test.  In this small-sample-size context, the tt-test is more appropriate.

- 2-sample zz-test
- sign test
- or paired-difference test.

7. To investigate whether there is a difference in scholastic abilities between first-borns and second-born siblings, 600 families that have at least two children were randomly selected. The scholastic abilities of the first-born and the second-born siblings were assessed with a test and are to be compared.

- z-test

- t-test
- 
- 2-sample zz-test

- **sign test**
> Because the natural units of the question are sibling pairs, the sign test is appropriate but not as sensitive as the paired-difference test.

- **paired-difference test**
> Because the natural units of the question are sibling pairs, the paired-difference test is the most appropriate.
