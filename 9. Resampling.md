## Quizz
1. We want to use the Monte Carlo method to estimate the probability of getting exactly one ace (one spot) in three rolls of die.
Which of the following is a correct description for doing this?

- To simulate the roll of a die, we draw a number at random (with replacement) from  1,2,3,4,5,6. 

- To simulate the probability in question with B=1000 Monte Carlo simulations, we simulate the roll of a die 3B=3000 times and count the number of times an ace comes up. Then we divide this number by 3B. The resulting proportion is our Monte Carlo estimate.

- To simulate three rolls of a die, we draw three times a number at random (with replacement) from 1,2,3,4,5,6.  If we get the number `1' exactly once, then we label this trial to be a success.

We repeat this B=1000 times. The proportion of successes in these 1000 trials is our Monte Carlo estimate of the probability in question.

- **To simulate three rolls of a die, we draw three times a number at random (with replacement) from 1,2,3,4,5,6. We repeat this simulation many times until we get the number `1' exactly once, then we stop. The desired Monte Carlo estimate is 1/(number of repetitions).**

> Dividing the number of three-roll trials of interest (those with exactly one ace) by the size of a larger population of random three-roll trials does give us an estimate of the probability of getting exactly one ace in three rolls of a die.

2. We want to use the Monte Carlo Method to approximate the standard error of our estimate from Question 1.
Which of the following is a correct description for doing this?

- We compute the standard deviation of the all the numbers we simulated in Question 1. 

- In each of the B=1000 trials we simulated in Question 1, if the trial results in a success (i.e. `1' shows exactly once), then we give that trial the label 1, otherwise the label 0. We compute the standard deviation of these 1000 labels. 
- **We repeat the whole Monte Carlo simulation done in Question 1 many times (e.g. 2000 times). Each time we get an estimate of the probability in question. We compute the standard deviation of these 2000 estimates.**

> Repeating the simulation from Question 1 gives us multiple estimates of the probability of getting exactly one ace in three rolls of a die.  This allows us to approximate the standard error of our estimate by computing the standard deviation of these multiple estimates.

3. We want to use the bootstrap to estimate the bias of hatθ

where θ is some function of our population of interest: θ=t(population) and hatθ =t(sample).  As usual,  we only have access to data from a sample of this population.

Which of the following is a correct description for doing this?

> This is the correct computation, where BB is the number bootstrap samples drawn from our population sample.

> Correlation is a function of a population of paired observations, for example child height and parent height. Drawing a bootstrap sample from this population of paired child-parent observations allows us to make multiple estimates of the corresponding correlation without ignoring the paired character of the observations.
