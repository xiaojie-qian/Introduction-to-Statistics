## Quizz
1. A random sample of 500 sales prices of recently purchased homes in a county is taken. From that sample a 90% confidence interval for the average sales price of all homes in the county is computed to be $215,000 +/- $35,000.
Is the following statement true or false?
"About 90% of all home sales in the county have a sales price in the range $215,000 +/- $35,000."

> false, A confidence interval is a statement about a sampling distribution; in our case, the sampling distribution of average values of all samples of size 500. The statement instead refers to the data the samples are being taken from, and not the averages of these samples. We would say "we can be 90% confident that home sales in the county have a sales price in the range...".

2. A random sample of 500 sales prices of recently purchased homes in a county is taken. From that sample a 90% confidence interval for the average sales price of all homes in the county is computed to be $215,000 +/- $35,000.
Is the following statement: true or false?
 "There is a 90% chance that the average sales price of all homes in the county is in the range $215,000 +/- $35,000."

> false, The average price of all houses is not a random value: It is certain to be in the interval or is certain not to be, so we can't talk about chance.

3. A poll of 400 eligible voters in a city finds that 313 plan to vote in the next election. Find a 95% confidence interval for the percentage of all eligible voters in the city who plan to vote.

> 100 * (400/313 ± 2 * ( (sqrt(313/400) * (1-313/400)) / sqrt(400))) , Let p be the proportion of voters in the sample who plan to vote; that is, 313/400. 
> Then the sample estimate of the standard deviation of the 0-1 labels in the larger population is sqrt(p(1-p)), and since the sample is size 400400, the standard error of the proportion is sqrt(p(1-p))/sqrt(400).  
> Since we want a 95% confidence interval, we multiply this by ±2 and add to p to get a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion.  We then multiply this interval by 100 to get the corresponding interval for the population percentage.
> The final numerical answer is thus: 78%±4.1%

4. Questions (a) and (b) below relate to the following: Based on a sample of 500 salaries in a large city we want to find a confidence interval for the average salary in that city.
Question (a): Is it possible to do this using the formula "average +/- z SE"?  (Keep in mind that the histogram of salaries is not normal but quite skewed.)

> yes, The central limit theorem tells us that the distribution of averages of samples of salaries is close to a normal distribution even if the distribution of all salaries is quite skewed.

5. The margin of error for the confidence interval from Question (a), which was based on 500 salaries, turns out to be $5,400. How many salaries do we need to sample in order to shrink the margin of error to about $2,000?

> (5400/2000)^2 * 500=3645 , In Question (a), the denominator used in the calculation of the margin of error is sqrt{500}, since the sample size is 500.  Since we want to shrink the margin of error from $5400 to $2000, we multiply this denominator 5400/2000.  
> Since (5400/2000) * sqrt(500) = sqrt((5400/2000)^2 * 500, this amounts to changing the sample size to (5400/2000)^2 * 500.

6. You are interested what the current starting salary for jobs in data 
science is. You solicit feedback on an online forum about data science 
and you get 230 replies with salary numbers. Can you use the formula 
"average +/- z SE" to find a confidence interval for the average 
starting salary?

> no, The replies are not a random sample of the starting salaries of forum participants. In addition, the sample is not being drawn from the population of all people who work in data science, but only from the population of all forum participants.
